Being born and raised in Kenya I saw the\n                    effects\n                    the environment had on the people, especially those who are poor and afflicted with cancer. This\n                    resurrected my passion for those poor families afflicted with cancer. I personally deal with these\n                    families and help them directly. According to national guidelines for cancer management in Kenya,\n                    cancer\n                    ranks third as the cause of morbidity and mortality. Kenya is carrying a heavy burden which is\n                    largely\n                    triggered by a shortage of cancer specialist and scarcity of chemotherapy in major hospitals. The\n                    pressure ripples the patient and their families causing those that are poor to wait in line for a\n                    long\n                    time increasing their mortality rate. Bills pile up and families end up spending their meager\n                    resources\n                    on the maintenance of the disease. There are some organizations that give occasional help to the\n                    patients but not to the devastated families.The gap that is left after the battle is won or lost is\n                    the\n                    main focus for my efforts. As little as $5 to an affected family can go along way.

Either with\n                    friends,\n                    relatives, or renting small rooms within some informal settlements.
